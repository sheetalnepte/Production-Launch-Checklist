INTRODUCTION
-------------

Production Launch Checklist eliminates guesswork by creating a functional to-do list of modules and tasks that remain before your site can go live. Most of the configuration are based on Time INC projects.
Current Features:
* List of module which need to be disabled with current status
* Data Summary
* System variables information
* Performance and scalability configuration with recommended settings

INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further information.
* To start using the module, go to admin/config/development/plc. It will pre-check any
completed items it is able to auto detect.
