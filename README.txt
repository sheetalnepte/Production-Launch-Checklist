INTRODUCTION
-------------

Are you suffering from launch nightmares??
Does you and your team burn nights to meet launch deadlines and still faces 
production issues? Every project has same kind of issues.
After launch you discover some configuration are missing or incorrect.
To solve this, I have come up with an idea were you don't have to worry 
before launch. I have created a Drupal module "Production Launch Checklist" 
which eliminates guesswork by creating a easy-to-use list of modules and 
other activities which must be completed before site launch. This module 
empowers website administrator to verify configurations on a single page and 
provides shortcut to modify any settings which saves valuable pre-launch time.

Benefit to business:
- Standardization of pre-launch activities, so that anyone can deploy site 
smoothly and consistently
- Timely website launch which is vital for success
- Saves lot of efforts to create and validate checklist for every new site

Current Features:
* List of module which need to be disabled with current status
* Data Summary
* System variables information
* Performance and scalability configuration with recommended settings

INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. 
See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 
for further information.
* To start using the module, go to admin/config/development/plc. It will 
pre-check any completed items it is able to auto detect.
